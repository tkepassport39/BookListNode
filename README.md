# Book List 

In the project directory I have a etc/local.env with environment variables to connect to my MongoDB Atlas collection. This folder was not uploaded due to sensitive info. 

Run `source etc/local.env` before starting

This project I'm using: 
 * Server - Express app, GraphQL
 * database - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
 * Client - [REACT](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Apollo](apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/) (help bind graphql to our REACT app), [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) (tool to view schema locally)
